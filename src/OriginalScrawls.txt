// Day 1 (1/17/2024)
// Two and a half hours, 264-284 lines in, and im only halfway done with setup...
// I still have Presentation, Graphics Pipeline Basics, and Drawing AS MAIN TABS left
//  . I literally haven't even selected a GPU to do anything with yet!
//
// For reference on how much different (and harder) this is to OpenGL, here is a link to the HelloTriangle for OpenGL
// . https://learnopengl.com/code_viewer_gh.php?code=src/1.getting_started/2.2.hello_triangle_indexed/hello_triangle_indexed.cpp

// Day 2 [Part 1] (1/18/2024)
//  . Start Time:  9:32   AM
//  . End   Time: 10:29   AM
//  . Line Count: 415-436 Lines
//
// It is now 10:13 AM and I am finished with the Setup part!
//  . Only 12-13 more sections to go until I can see the triangle!!!!! (I have done 5 so far)
//
// The time has advanced to 10:29 AM and I have to prepare and leave for class.
// . I have completed another section, getting the presentation queue

// Day 2 [Part 2] (1/18/2024)
//  . Start Time: 12:46   PM
//  . End   Time: 05:21   PM
//  . Line Count: 000-000 Lines
//
// Its currently 1:43 PM, towering at around 599 lines of code, and I have finally created the swapchain
//
// Its currently 1:56 PM, with 644 liens of code I am finally to the Graphics Pipeline!
//  . I am going o take a temporary break, be back soon.
// It is 2:25 PM, I have returned
//
// The time is 3:28 PM, coming to around 828 lines of code the fixed-function pipeline has finally been finished!
//  . Just 6 more sections to go.
//
// Its 4:15, and I have 'finished' the Graphics Pipeline
//  . But it doesn't work :(, time to debug
// Its now 4:21, and I have fixed it! The Graphics Pipeline has been created!!!
//  . There are currently around 891 lines of code. Still no triangle
//
// Its approaching 5 PM (currently 4:51 PM) and the draw command has been issued. Its still not ready to view yet though
//  . It currently (at the time of writing this line) can be found at line: 1006
//  . There are currently around 1012 lines of code.
//
// The time is 5:21 PM and IT IS GLORIOUS!
//  . Countless hours, headaches, and 1102 lines of code later, there is a triangle on the screen!
// Also side note, CLion Nova is currently taking up 8 GB in Task Manager (so probably more). It has not been restarted since Day 1.

// Its actually painful to navigate this file

// TODO: Read this at some point: https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-memory-management

// Some Notes
//  . It seems that if you wanted to have different vertex types, you must create a new graphics pipeline for them
